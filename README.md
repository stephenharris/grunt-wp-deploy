# grunt-wp-deploy

> Deploys a git Repo to the WordPress SVN repo

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `>=0.4.1` and node `>=6.0.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-wp-deploy --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-wp-deploy');
```

## The "wp_deploy" task

This task is for deploying a plug-in to the [WordPress repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) from a 'build directory'. 

### Before you start, you'll need...
 1. To have been [accepted](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/) on to the WordPress repository
 2. **plugin-slug** - You can get this from your plug-in's repo url: *https://wordpress.org/plugins/{plugin-slug}*
 3. **readme.txt** (or `readme.md`) - See [https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/#readme](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/#readme) 
 4. **plugin-slug.php** - The 'main file' of the plug-in (containing the plugin header).
 5. **build directory** - This a complete copy of the plug-in as you want it on the directory
 6. (Optional) **assets directory** - This directory should contain the plug-in's screenshots and other files you want in the 'assets' directory in the root of the plug-ins WordPress SVN repo. See [https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/faq/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/faq/) for details.

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `wp_deploy` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
	wp_deploy: {
		deploy: { 
			options: {
				plugin_slug: 'your-plugin-slug',
				svn_user: 'your-wp-repo-username',	
				build_dir: 'build', //relative path to your build directory
				assets_dir: 'wp-assets' //relative path to your assets directory (optional).
			},
		}
	},
})
```

### Options

#### options.plugin_slug
Type: `String`
Default value: `false`

Your plug-in's slug as indicated by its repository url *https://wordpress.org/plugins/{plugin-slug}*

#### options.plugin_main_file
Type: `String`
Default value: `false`

Use this option if the name of your plug-in's main file (the PHP file with WordPress plugin headers) differs from the slug name. Pass the full file name with extension, e.g.: *my-plugin.php*

#### options.svn_user
Type: `String`
Default value: `false`

Your WordPress repository username. If not provided, you'll be prompted for this when the task runs.

#### options.build_dir
Type: `String`
Default value: `false`

The directory where the plug-in exists as you want it on the repo.

#### options.assets_dir
Type: `String`
Default value: `false`

The directory where the plug-in's assets (i.e. screenshots) exist. This gets copied into the 'assets' directory in the root of your WordPress SVN repo. Typically
this directory contains your plug-in's screenshots, which you want uploaded to the WordPress repo, but do not necessary want included in the plug-in distrubted 
to users. For more details see: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/faq/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/faq/).

#### options.svn_url
Type: `String`
Default value: `https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/{plugin-slug}/`

For flexibilty this plug-in can work with other repos. Simple provide the SVN url, using `{plugin-slug}` as placeholder indicating where the plug-in slug should be.

#### options.max_buffer
Type: `Integer`
Default value: `200*1024`

Sets the maximum buffer for the SVN checkout of the repo. 

#### options.tmp_dir
Type: `String`
Default value: `/tmp/`

Location where your SVN repository is checked out to. **Note:** Before the the repository is checked out `<tmp_dir>/<plugin_slug>` is deleted.

#### options.skip_confirmation
Type: `Bool`
Default value: `false`

If `false`, you will be asked for confirmation before commiting the plug-in to the repository. This will give you the opportunity to inspect the `trunk` in the `options.tmp_dir` to see what is being committed.

#### options.deploy_trunk
Type: `Bool`
Default value: `true`

Whether to deploy to trunk. This could be set to `false` to only commit the assets directory.

#### options.deploy_tag
Type: `Bool`
Default value: `true`

Whether to deploy to a tag. You will need to have set to `options.deploy_trunk` to `true`. This can set to `false` to only deploy to trunk (e.g. when only updating the 'Tested up to' value and not deploying a release).
